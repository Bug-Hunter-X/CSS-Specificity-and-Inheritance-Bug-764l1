The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is expected to override the others */
}
```

This code intends to set the text color of paragraphs within a div to green. However, if the inheritance and specificity rules of CSS are not carefully considered, unexpected results might occur.
